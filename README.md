# Wikipedia section extraction

This project aims to extract texts from Wikipedia, divide them into individual sections, and then store them in a database. It provides a simple way to capture both random articles and articles from Wikipedia's Vital list and process them accordingly.

Functionalities:
1. Retrieve Random Wikipedia Articles: The application can retrieve random Wikipedia articles and extract their text.
2. Extraction of Vital Articles: In addition to random article selection, the tool also allows retrieval of articles from Wikipedia's Vital list and extraction of their content.
3. Text Segmentation: The extracted text is divided into individual sections or paragraphs to prepare the data for efficient storage and subsequent processing.
4. Database Integration: The segmented texts are stored in a database for later retrieval, analysis, machine learning, or other purposes.
